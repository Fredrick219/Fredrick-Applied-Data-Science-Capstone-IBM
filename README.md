**Project Title: Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**

**Description:**

This project aims to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing during SpaceX rocket launches. Understanding the likelihood of a successful landing is crucial as it directly impacts the cost-effectiveness of rocket launches. SpaceX offers significantly lower launch costs compared to other providers primarily because of its ability to reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. By accurately predicting the success of the first stage landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch, which can be valuable information for alternate companies bidding against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to collect data from an API and ensure it is in the correct format for analysis. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a predictive model that can determine the probability of a successful Falcon 9 first stage landing. This predictive capability can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding rocket launch contracts and potentially improve cost efficiencies in the space launch industry.

**Key Features:**

- Data collection from an API: The project involves retrieving data related to Falcon 9 rocket launches, specifically focusing on the success or failure of the first stage landing.
- Data preprocessing: Ensuring that the collected data is in the correct format for analysis, including cleaning, formatting, and feature engineering.
- Machine learning model development: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model based on historical data of Falcon 9 launches.
- Evaluation and validation: Assessing the performance of the predictive model using appropriate metrics and validation techniques to ensure its reliability and accuracy.
- Cost estimation: Using the predictive model to estimate the cost of a launch based on the likelihood of a successful first stage landing.
